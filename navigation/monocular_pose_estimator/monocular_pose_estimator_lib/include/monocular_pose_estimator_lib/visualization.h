   * Projects the body-fixed coordinate frame onto the image.
   *
   * The function takes a list of 4 vector points, the fist one being the origin of the coordinate frame and the
   * remaining 3 points being the coordinates of the end of the illustrative vectors of the coordinate frame. It projects
   * the lines/vectors illustrating the coordinate frame onto the image.
   *
   * \param image (input & output) the image onto which the coordinate frame will be projected.
   * \param points_to_project the four 3D points that are to be projected onto the image and connected together to form the coordinate frame.\n
   *         - The first point is the origin of the coordinate frame\n
   *         - The second point is the vector from the origin along the x-axis\n
   *         - The third point is the vector from the origin along the y-axis\n
   *         - The fourth point is the vector from the origin along the z-axis
   * \param camera_matrix_K the camera calibration matrix (without distortion correction) = \f$ \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
   *                         f_x & 0 & c_x \\

   *                         0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] \f$
   * \param camera_distortion_coeffs the vector containing the 4, 5 or 8 distortion coefficients of the camera \f$ (k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6]]) \f$
