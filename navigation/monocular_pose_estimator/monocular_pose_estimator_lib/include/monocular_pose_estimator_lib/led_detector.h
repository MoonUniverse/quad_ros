  /**
   * Detects the LEDs in the image and returns their positions in the rectified image and also draws circles around the detected LEDs in an output image.
   *
   * The image is thresholded where everything smaller than the threshold is set to zero. I.e.,
   * \f[
   \mathbf{I}^\prime (u, v) = \begin{cases} \mathbf{I}(u, v), & \mbox{if } \mathbf{I}(u, v) > \mbox{threshold}, \\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise}. \end{cases}
   * \f]
   *
   *
   * Thereafter the image is Gaussian smoothed. Contours are extracted and their areas are determined. Blobs with
   * too large, or too small an area are ignored. Blobs that are not sufficiently round are also ignored.
   *
   * The centre of the extracted blobs is calculated using the method of moments. The centre \f$(\hat{u}, \hat{v})\f$ is calculated as \n
   * \f{eqnarray*}{
   *       \hat{u} & = & M_{10} / M_{00}, \\
   *       \hat{v} & = & M_{01} / M_{00}.

   * \param min_blob_area the minimum blob area to be detected (in pixels squared)
   * \param max_blob_area the maximum blob area to be detected (in pixels squared)
   * \param max_width_height_distortion the maximum distortion ratio of the width of the blob to the height of the blob. Calculated as \f$1-\frac{\mbox{width}}{\mbox{height}}\f$
   * \param max_circular_distortion the maximum distortion circular distortion ratio, calculated as \f$ 1- \frac{\mbox{area}}{(\mbox{width}/2)^2} \f$ or \f$ 1- \frac{\mbox{area}}{(\mbox{height}/2)^2} \f$
   * \param pixel_positions (output) the vector containing the pixel positions of the centre of the detected blobs
   * \param distorted_detection_centers (output) centers of the LED detection in the distorted image (only used for visualization)
